# Migration from VMware to Kubernetes with KubeVirt

## Project Overview

This project aims to migrate an existing legacy system from VMware to Kubernetes using KubeVirt to enhance scalability, resource utilization, and streamline infrastructure management.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Assessment and Planning

1. **Inventory of VMs:**
   - Create a detailed list of all VMs including:
     - VM names
     - CPU configurations
     - Memory allocations
     - Disk sizes and types
     - Operating systems and versions
   - Document dependencies such as:
     - Inter-VM communications
     - External services
     - Specific configurations or custom scripts

2. **Network Configurations:**
   - Map out the network topology:
     - IP addressing schemes
     - VLAN configurations
     - Firewall rules and policies
     - Load balancer configurations
   - Identify any potential network bottlenecks or single points of failure.

3. **Storage Configurations:**
   - Document current storage solutions:
     - Types of storage (NFS, SAN, local disks)
     - Datastore configurations
     - Storage performance requirements (IOPS, latency)
   - Plan for storage migration and data integrity checks.

4. **External Services Dependencies:**
   - List all external services:
     - Databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL)
     - Authentication services (e.g., LDAP, AD)
     - APIs and external integrations
   - Assess the impact of migration on these services and plan accordingly.

### 2. Migration Strategy

1. **Choose Strategy:**
   - **Lift-and-Shift:**
     - Suitable for quick migrations with minimal changes.
     - Use tools like `virt-v2v` to convert VMware VMs to KubeVirt-compatible formats (e.g., QCOW2).
     - Focus on ensuring that VMs run as expected in the new environment.
   - **Refactoring:**
     - Suitable for applications that can benefit from microservices architecture.
     - Break down monolithic applications into smaller, manageable microservices optimized for Kubernetes.
   - **Rearchitecting:**
     - Suitable for complete redesigns to fully leverage Kubernetes.
     - Design infrastructure and applications from scratch with Kubernetes-native patterns.

### 3. Implementation

1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Choose a deployment method:
     - Local testing: Use Minikube.
     - Production: Use a managed Kubernetes service (GKE, EKS, AKS).
   - Set up the cluster:
     - Ensure high availability (HA) setup if needed.
     - Configure networking (e.g., CNI plugins).
     - Set up persistent storage (e.g., CSI drivers).

2. **Install and Configure KubeVirt:**
   - Follow the [KubeVirt installation guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/).
   - Verify the installation:
     - Ensure KubeVirt components are running correctly.
     - Test basic VM operations (e.g., create, start, stop VMs).

3. **Migrate VMs to KubeVirt:**
   - Convert VMs:
     - Use `virt-v2v` to convert VMware VMs to QCOW2 images.
     - Example command:
       ```
       virt-v2v -i vmx /path/to/vm.vmx -o local -os /path/to/output
       ```
   - Create KubeVirt VM resources:
     - Example KubeVirt VM YAML:
       ```
       apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
       kind: VirtualMachine
       metadata:
         name: myvm
       spec:
         running: false
         template:
           spec:
             domain:
               devices:
                 disks:
                 - disk:
                     bus: virtio
                   name: containerdisk
                   volumeName: containervolume
             volumes:
             - name: containervolume
               containerDisk:
                 image: kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo
       ```

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data:
     ```
     kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.txt
     ```
   - Use Secrets for sensitive data:
     ```
     kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username='admin' --from-literal=password='s3cr3t'
     ```

### 4. Testing and Validation

1. **Testing:**
   - Functional Testing:
     - Ensure each migrated application operates correctly.
     - Validate all services and interdependencies.
   - Network Testing:
     - Use tools like `ping`, `curl`, and `traceroute` to validate network connectivity.
   - Storage Testing:
     - Use tools like `fio` or `dd` to validate storage access and performance.
   - Performance Testing:
     - Monitor application performance under load.
     - Compare with baseline performance metrics from the VMware environment.

### 5. Documentation and Training

1. **Document Migration Process:**
   - Provide step-by-step documentation of the migration process.
   - Include details on:
     - Preparation and planning
     - Tools and commands used
     - Issues encountered and resolutions
     - Post-migration validation steps

2. **Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions for the operations team:
     - Managing the Kubernetes environment
     - Using KubeVirt for VM management
     - Monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Provide access to training materials and resources.

### 6. Additional Considerations

1. **Implement CI/CD Pipelines:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and updates.
   - Tools to consider:
     - Jenkins
     - GitLab CI
     - ArgoCD

2. **Monitoring and Resource Utilization:**
   - Set up monitoring tools:
     - Prometheus for metrics collection
     - Grafana for visualization
     - Alertmanager for alerting
   - Configure alerts for:
     - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
     - VM performance
     - Application health
